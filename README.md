run_analysis.R contains the following steps: 

  Step 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  Step 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  
  Step 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  
  Step 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  
  Step 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each    activity and each subject
